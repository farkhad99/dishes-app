## Implementation

1. What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

-> I used several of them for quick frontend setup.
Axios - for making requests and handling them
UI library: Element Plus is a library of ready to use components on top of vue3 framework
Vuex - client store management, great for the vue ecosystem
Vue-router - for handling navigation and common routing through the vue project
ESLint and Prettied - linters and formatters for better code style

2. What would you change about your implementation if you had to handle thousands of items?


   -> 1. I would change the script and template languages to typescript for better dev experience.
3. I would use better UX and UI for fetching data and navigation (instead of dialogs), would add infinitescroll, some caching techniques for handling huge amount of data on clientside
4. Components bundle size, need to look at the dynamic imports and routing

## General

1. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?


   -> I would add more error handling cases. So here is the list of the features I would add:

- Filters and search
- View data or more data fields to detail a dish
- Better design, I guess, transitions if needed
- User roles

2. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?


   -> The structure of the project. I can say it is clear to add or remove a feature in the project: store model, a page, component, api endpoint
   
   
3. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
   The part of brainstorming and creating first mockups, how to actually represent data in the most effective, quickest way

4. How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

- It is actually a good one, I can say. I did have some difficulties in timing :) I guess I chose the wrong day to start because I got busy accidentally by my current job. But overall I've enjoyed it)
  I would spend more time improving the website.)
